<h1>The Best Movies According to Chlesea</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>
This is classic retro sci-fi movie features incredible visual effect and delves into the impact of virtual reality technology.
</p>

<h3>Farewell My Concubine</h3>
<p>
   As times change, peopleâ€™s fates rise and fall, often held captive by the era. At the turning point of history, some are thrust into the spotlight in an instant, while others sink into oblivion. Yu Ji is the real Yu Ji, but the Overlord is a false one.</p>

<h3>No More Bets</h3>
<p>
   The rise and fall of a massive fraud syndicate, based on a true story, is definitely worth watching.
